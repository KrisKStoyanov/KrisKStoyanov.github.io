<h1>Kristiyan Stoyanov</h1>
<h2>Software Developer, Full-Stack Web Developer, Game Developer</h2>
<p>I've been writing code for 4 years during my education at Coventry University, 
    and 4 years afterwards while switching around different developer jobs. 
    I've written code for rendering systems, proprietary game engines, developer SDKs, 
    ERP systems for managing a construction company, back-end servers handling financial 
    operations of point-of-sale devices, web apps and web games.
</p>
<p>
    I'm currently developing my next game with C# using the MonoGame Framework. Currently there is no set date for 
    completion. I will attempt to release a short playable demo around the end of the year.
