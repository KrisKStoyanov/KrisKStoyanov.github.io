# The short version on how I got here

I grew up in a small suburb in Bulgaria, where the first portion of my childhood was spent playing outdoor games with the local kids and the latter was finding the next video game to play on my SNES. Over time, I gained more insight into how the video games I played were being developed and at some point it clicked with me that I had a the opportunity to build my future around this hobby of mine.

A few years and a degree in Games Technology later, and I find myself looking for the next job to carry me into the industry I cherished to find a place for so long in. And so after getting my first job with Codemasters, we managed to ship to both PC, current and last gen consoles the last game in the GRID franchise with GRID Legends. I did not anticipate how difficult a job in the field can get and so quickly decided to jump ship to one of the largest players in the field with Sony PlayStation, also formerly known as SIE (Sony Interactive Entertainment).
As things did not work out between me and the team, we eventually decided to split paths and I was formally laid off from a job for the first time in my life on the 1st of April, 2022.

Eventually, I decided to follow up on the skills I have gained and continue my career in my home country. I was a technical support engineer for a while until I realized that is not exactly what I see myself doing long-term, so I moved into the nearest company that was looking for actual developers. While fintech is not exactly affiliated with game development, I was able to practice some of my skills and knowledge while gaining insight into how things are built in the financial sector. After 5 months we decided to formally part ways as things weren't working out the way they had anticipated in relation to performance of productivity.

I'm hopeful that this short presentation on my upbringing and how I got where I am was able to clear up most of the questions you, or the next reader who stumbles here, would have for me otherwise.
