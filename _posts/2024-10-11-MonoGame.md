MonoGame is a familiar environment for me. While it lacks the elegance of commercial game engines
like Unity and Unreal Engine, it is at it's core running under the same fundamental principles that ever other game development software also does. Those fundamentals being an initialization function 
where everything is configured prior to being utilized further on at runtime, a method for loading
the necessary assets for the current project, an update function where gameplay logic would be written,
and a draw method where the rendering happens. 

I need to understand how the MCB fits into the full picture. Right now it seems to me that it is some form of asset loader with a neat GUI wrapped around it. More research is needed on it.
